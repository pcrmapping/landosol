# `landosol`

A hub for *PriConne Mapping* activities. Developed using Pynecone.

## Dev guide

Copy `pcconfig_example.py` to `pcconfig.py`, and run a `pipenv sync` to install dependencies.

Once that's done you should be able to run the application through `pipenv run pc run` (that's a mouthful, I know).
